# Springboard - Machine Learning Engineer Career Track

This program teaches all of the fundementals of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.
It includes a set of mini projects and a capstone project.

My Capstone Project is to predict the likelihood of a team winning a basketball game.
Using webscrapped data from 2000-2020 season, data is manipulated to have advanced metrics and rolling team statistics.

Model is currently deployed in production locally, but will create a public API shortly for demo purposes

Under is a Table of Contents which outlines the curriculum through mini projects, capstone submissions, the current and future outlook of the capstone project
