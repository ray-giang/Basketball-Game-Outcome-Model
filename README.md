This program teaches all of the fundementals of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.
It includes a set of mini projects and a capstone project.

My Capstone Project is to predict the likelihood of a team winning a basketball game.

Model is currently deployed in production locally, but will create a public API shortly for demo purposes
